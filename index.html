        This website is designed to be a light introduction page for me to
        showcase some of my skillsets and experiences as a rising web developer.
        The targeted audience for the website can include any possible employers
        or anyone who might want to know about my background in web development.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="bio">
          I am currently a second-year student at the Unversity of Chapel Hill.
          During the lockdown, my time spent in front of my laptop increased
          significantly. This rise in screentime leads me to realize how
          elaborate and innovative web pages are. I was then curious about the
          underlying mechanism of these platforms that could decode and analyze
          user behaviors and precisely target the users' needs, which led to the
          current time where I am studying Information Science at the SILS
          branch to pursue a career as a Web Developer.
